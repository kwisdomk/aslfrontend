# Athena | Strategic Roadmap (HPI Edition)

## Overview
Athena is a high-performance intelligence planner designed to balance the dual workloads of the **IBM i3 Internship** (Professional Arm) and **Computer Science Degree** (Academic Arm). It implements the "Swerve Protocol" to dynamically adjust priorities based on critical bottlenecks and hardware constraints.

## Project Roadmap
View the development roadmap for the Athena application here: **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)**

## Core Systems

### 1. Dual-Arm Architecture
- **Professional Arm**: Tracks IBM TechZone badges, QRadar deployment, and CEH certification.
- **Academic Arm**: Monitors University units (Data Science, Math Foundations) and critical deadlines.

### 2. Logic Gates & Protocols
- **Swerve Protocol**: Automatically detects "Academic Lag". If academic progress drops 15% below professional progress, the UI alerts to shift focus immediately.
- **HPI Velocity Tracker**: Calculates a velocity coefficient (Target > 1.1x) based on progress points achieved vs. hours logged.
- **Hardware Awareness**: Recommends "Performance", "Efficiency", or "Silent" modes to optimize the i5-13420H & 8GB RAM constraints during high-load tasks (e.g., QRadar VMs).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Core**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-3-flash-preview`)
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd athena-strategic-planner
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure API Key**
   *   Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
   *   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory.
   *   Add your key:
       ```env
       VITE_API_KEY=your_key_here
       ```
   *   *Note: `.env.local` is ignored by git to keep your key secure.*

4. **Initialize Athena**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

# Athena Development Roadmap | Project "Cortex"

> **Objective**: Evolve Athena from a static dashboard into a fully persistent, AI-driven Operating System for HPI career management.

## 📍 Phase 1: Persistence & Data Sovereignty (Current Priority)
**Goal**: Allow Wisdom to edit progress in real-time without touching the code.
- [ ] **State Persistence**: Implement `localStorage` or `IndexedDB` hooks so progress bars don't reset on refresh.
- [ ] **Edit Mode**: Add "Edit" buttons to cards to manually input new progress percentages (e.g., updating QRadar from 57% to 60%).
- [ ] **Task Creation**: Ability to add new Tasks/Bottlenecks dynamically via the UI.

## 🧠 Phase 2: Tactical AI Integration (The "Planner")
**Goal**: Move from "Status Reporting" to "Active Scheduling".
- [ ] **"Generate Day Plan"**: A button that prompts Gemini to generate an hour-by-hour schedule based on:
    - Current "Swerve" status.
    - Available hours (user input).
    - Hardware constraints (e.g., "Do QRadar first while laptop is cool").
- [ ] **Bottleneck Breaker**: A dedicated AI mode that specifically breaks down a stuck task (e.g., "QRadar Tuning") into 15-minute micro-steps.

## 📊 Phase 3: Analytics & Velocity Tracking
**Goal**: Visualize HPI Velocity over time.
- [ ] **Velocity Graph**: A line chart showing `(Progress / Hours)` over the last 30 days.
- [ ] **Focus Heatmap**: Visualizing which hours of the day yield the highest output.
- [ ] **Streak Tracking**: Gamification of consecutive days with Velocity > 1.1.

## 🔗 Phase 4: External Integrations (The Ecosystem)
**Goal**: Connect Athena to the outside world.
- [ ] **Google Calendar Sync**: Push generated AI schedules directly to Google Calendar.
- [ ] **IBM TechZone Webhook**: (Long term) Attempt to fetch badge status automatically if an API is available, or parse a pasted profile URL.

## 🛡️ Phase 5: Hardware Telemetry (The "Node")
**Goal**: Real-time hardware awareness.
- [ ] **Battery/Resource Monitor**: Use the Web Performance API to detect if the laptop is in "Low Power Mode" and automatically switch Athena to "Academic/Reading" suggestions.
